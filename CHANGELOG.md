## 0.0.1 (2026-10-12)

The first QuickAI release. QuickAI is a fork of
[ThukiWin](https://github.com/ayzekhdawy/thukiwin), reworked as a cloud-only,
bilingual Windows overlay.

### Features

* **Cloud-only AI providers** — OpenAI, Anthropic, and any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint (custom base URL, model, and API key). API keys are stored locally in
  a SQLite `app_config` table.
* **Bilingual interface** — English and Simplified Chinese, auto-detected from
  the system language with a manual switcher on the Settings → Display tab.
* **Windows overlay** — double-tap <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to summon a floating overlay
  from any app, including fullscreen ones; highlight text first to open with it
  pre-filled as a quote.
* **Main chat, vision, and extended reasoning** — streaming responses, image
  attachments and `/screen` captures sent to the provider as vision input, and
  `/think` mapped to the provider's reasoning mode.
* **Computer control via `/do`** — agent mode drives your desktop using native
  OpenAI / Anthropic tool calling.
* **Utility commands** — `/translate`, `/rewrite`, `/tldr`, `/refine`,
  `/bullets`, and `/todos`.
* **Conversation history** persisted in a local SQLite database.
* **Minibar mode** and desktop notification toasts.

### Removals

* Removed local Ollama inference and the local inference configuration.
* Removed the self-hosted agentic web-search pipeline (`/search`).
* Removed the local OpenAI-compatible gateway.
* Removed text-to-speech (read aloud) and the notification-sound option.
* Removed Turkish intent-detection phrases (English and Chinese are kept).

### Build & Release

* Automated releases via release-please.
* Each release publishes an **NSIS installer** and a **portable zip**
  (`QuickAI_<version>_x64_portable.zip`).
